    >What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

A: Linked lists are faster for a computer to process because they do not require sequential memory bits, which allows linked lists to grow easily. However, because the lists can be stored in any available memory, they have to point the processor to the next node in the list. The processor has to jump around more to find all of the nodes in a single list. Also as a con, the list must be searched always starting from the beginning.

    >Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

A: A real world example of a linked list would be a grocery list. In the same way a shopper would bounce around the store finding all of the items on the list, so does the processor in search of all items in a linked list.

####Programming Questions

>The linked list push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is pseudocode for a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Submit both an explanation of the bug and a functional implementation of the method.

```
Given:
FUNCTION push(element)
CREATE node
SET node.value TO element
SET node.next TO null

IF the head node does not exist
 THEN SET head to node
ELSE
 SET current to head
 SET current.next to node
END IF
END FUNCTION
```

The `else` statement will cause an error. The `if` statement is providing the function to set THIS node to head if one does not exist, however, with the given `else` statement, the node will ALWAYS set to head, which will make the entire list inaccessible because the `next` locations will always be wrong.
Further, the `set current.next to node` seems incorrect. I think we need to set the location of the node to node.

```
Refactored:
FUNCTION push(element)
CREATE node
SET node.value TO element
SET node.next TO null

IF the head node does not exist
 THEN SET head to node
ELSE
 //SET current to head
SET node.next to node
END IF
END FUNCTION


function push(element) {
  create node;
  node.value = element;
  node.next = null;

  if (headNode === null) {
  headNode = node;
  }
  else {
  node.next = node;
  }
}
```

> Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
Example:
Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
Output: a -> c -> d

FUNCTION removeDuplicates(list)
set temp to headNode

WHILE the temp is not null
  set nextNode to temp.next
  WHILE nextNode is not null
  COMPARE temp to nextNode
    IF temp.value equals nextNode.value
      THEN set temp.next = nextNode.next;
      Delete nextNode;
    else continue;
    End IF
    set nextNode equal to nextNode.next
    End While
  set temp equal to temp.next
  end While
End function


function removeDuplicates(list) {
  temp = headNode;
  while (temp !== null) {
    nextNode = temp.next;
    while (nextNode !== null) {
      if (temp.value === nextNode.value) {
        temp.next = nextNode.next;
        delete nextNode;
      }
      nextNode = nextNode.next;
    }
    temp = temp.next;
  }
}



>Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
Example:
Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a

FUNCTION reverse(list)
set temp to headNode
while temp.next does not equal null
  set temp.next to headNode
end While
End Function

function reverse(list) {
  temp = headNode;
  while (temp.next !== null) {
    temp.next = headNode;
  }
}
