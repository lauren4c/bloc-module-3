###Assignment

#####Short Answer
>1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A: Looking for a spice in the spice rack: My spice rack is not very organized, so I end up looking through everything to find the spice I need.

>2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A: Looking up a number in a phone book - you can narrow down where you need to be by opening any to any page in the book.

>3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
A: 7 Interations.

>4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
A: 3 Iterations.

>5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: A Linear search is the only way to find an item because the collection is unsorted.

>6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: A Binary search would be much faster in a sorted collection, as it could quickly narrow down the location of the search item much faster than a Linear search, which has to go through every single item.

#####Programming Assignment:

>1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
function findWord(collection, value){

  var low = collection[0];
  var high = collection[-1];

  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = (low + high)/2;
    if (collection[mid] > value) {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
    else if (collection[mid] < value) {
      low = mid +1;
    }
    else
    return mid;
  }
  return not found;
}

findWord('dictionary', 'albatross');

>2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.
function netFish(collection, fish){
  let result = null, value;

  for (var i = 0; i< collection.length, i++) {
    value = collection[i];
    if (value === fish){
      result = 1;
      break;
    }
  }
  return result;
}

netFish('fish Tank', "white spotted fish");
