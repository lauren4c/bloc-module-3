Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

    Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

    INPUT first number
    INPUT second number
    COMPARE the numbers
    RETURN the greater number


    Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

    INPUT Number 1
    RETURN Number
    WHILE Number is less than 100,
     	ADD 1 to previous NUMBER
     	RETURN next number
     END WHILE



    Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

    SEARCH FOR X
   	FOR each entry in Phonebook
   		compare X to Entry 
   			If X is equal to entry,
   				RETURN ENTRY
   			IF X is NOT EQUAL to entry,
   				CONTINUE




   > Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

###JavaScript

function compare(x, y)
    if (x>y) {
    	return x;
    	}
    	else return y;

<!---------------------->

i = 0;

function printAll() {
  while (i<100) {
    console.log(i + 1);
	i++;
  }
}

<!---------------------->

function phonebookSearch(phonebook, x) {
	for (let i = 0; i<phonebook.length; i++) {
		if (i === x) {
		return i;
		}
		else continue;
		}
	}
